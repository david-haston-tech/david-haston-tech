# David James Haston

Senior Full Stack Engineer with **10+ years of experience** designing, building, and scaling production-grade web applications across startups and enterprise environments.  
I specialize in **frontend architecture**, **full-stack systems**, and **high-performance user experiences**, with a strong focus on **React, TypeScript, Node.js, and cloud-native platforms**.

I’ve led and owned critical frontend and full-stack systems end-to-end — from architecture and design systems to performance optimization, CI/CD, and cross-team collaboration.
